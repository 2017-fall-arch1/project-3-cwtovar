# Project 3: LCD Game
## Description
The game I encoded is a variation of Asteriods.
The score is incremented when the objects bounce off the boundaries.
If your score reaches the ASCII value of '?'
   -A print message of "You Lose" displays and the board resets.

In order to decrease you score and keep it from reaching '?' you must chase the objects.
   -When they bounce off of you, they decrease your score by 1.

There are different buzzer noises that sound depending on whether the objects are bounced off of the player or bounced off the wall.

## Implementation

Adapted from shape-motion-demo implementing my own triangle shape using rectangle and arrow as a basis.
Assistance from Amin Karabash in understanding where Regions get their bounds, as well as Stack Overflow in debugging switch input.
Also buzzzzzer funtionality taken from Project 2.
